## Python code implementation of outputing possible string permutation given a string.
**Note: I do not recommend inserting a lengthy string since that will result a huge list, might give you an error**
**If you insert a string with a length of 3, the output is 3! = 6 outcomes**
**Imagine you insert a string with a length of 7, the output is 7! = 5040 outcomes**
